- In eGNN for classification, the main parameters are 'Rho' and 'hr'.
The default type of neurons is min-max. This can also be changed for different datasets. 

1 - Run 'O1DataDistribution' to generate a datastream, or create/load your own 
DataStream.mat file using your data.

2 - Run 'O2eGNN' to construct the neural model for classification.

3 - Files 'VisualGranules', 'DecisionBound', and 'PerfTest' are useful for 
visualization and analyses latter, if desired. The 'PerfTest' file may require 
adjustments for specific results.
